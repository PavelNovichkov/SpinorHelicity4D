# SpinorHelicity4D

Temporary readme and folder structure, to be edit soon...

Public release of the Mathematica package SpinorHelicity4D, which deals with massless 4d spinor helicity.
Application to massive case is taken into account through appropriate reference spinors.

Allows for analytic manipulation as well as numeric applications, including generation of fully rational kinematics even in mixed
massless/massive configurations.
