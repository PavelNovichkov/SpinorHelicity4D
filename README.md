# SpinorHelicity4D

Temporary readme and folder structure, to be edited soon...

Public release of the Mathematica package SpinorHelicity4D, which deals with massless 4d spinor helicity. Application to massive case is taken into account through appropriate reference spinors.

Allows for analytic manipulation as well as numeric applications, including generation of fully rational kinematics even in mixed massless/massive configurations.

In order to use the package either clone the repository and add the path to repository on your local machine to the Mathematica init.m file in the Kernels folder (add AppendTo[$Path,"local/directory/path/here"] to the init file, for location of init file and further details see documentation here https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/file/init.m.html), or paste the content of the cloned folder to your Mathematica Applications folder (for location of this folder see here https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/WolframSystemFileOrganization.html).

Once the package is loaded, information on single functions can be obtained as usual through ?FunctionName, a more complete documentation is on the way...
